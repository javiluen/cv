    <h3>Things that I still need to improve on</h3>
    <p>
        <ul> 
            <li>I need to pay more attention to detail.</li>
            <li>I also should focus more on the message, making it clear and crisp, being efficient with my words.</li>
            <li>I should look at the big picture of the things that we are doing.</li>
        </ul>
